## Description

This is a language designed to be better than English. English has many flaws in its sentance structure and alphabet and this project aims to fix that. In this language, no two letters make a different sound together than apart, there are no silent letters, and no two letters make the same sound. In this repository, there is a keyboard for typing in this language and a dictionary.
